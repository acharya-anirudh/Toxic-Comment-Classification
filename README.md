# Toxic-Comment-Classification
## Files: 
1. Phase_1_2.ipnb: This file contains EDA and Logistic Regression with multi label classification code.
2. Phase_3.ipynb: This file contains the approach using LSTM neural networks.
3. Class Imbalance_ML.ipynb: This file addresses the issue of class imbalance and is run on logisitic regression model again.
4. Class Imbalance_NN.ipynb: This file addresses the issue of class imbalance and runs LSTM model again.

## Instruction on running the code:
1. We assume that you run this on a Linux Machine. If you have windows, having Anaconda installed would be a better idea.
2. Download Datasaet and store it in the same directory as all the four python notebook files.
3. Download Word Embeddings and store it in the same directory as all the four python notebook files.
3. run pip install -r requirements.txt in terminal
4. Open notebook Phase_1_2.ipynb and proceed to run all cells. 
5. Open notebook Phase_3.ipynb and proceed to run all cells. 
6. Open notebook Class Imbalance_ML.ipynb and proceed to run all cells. 
7. Open notebook Class Imbalance_NN.ipynb and proceed to run all cells.
